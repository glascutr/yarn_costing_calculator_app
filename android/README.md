# `android/` — Developer / Agent Guide

Purpose: Android-specific build, packaging, and native plugin code.

When to edit:
- Native plugin changes, Gradle config, or signing changes.

How to build locally:
- From repo root: `flutter build apk` or open `android/` in Android Studio.

Agent notes:
- Document native API surface changes and update `CLAUDE.md` if cross-platform behavior changes.
